### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Danesh, an enthusiastic and optimistic data analyst working towards a career in data science. I had numerous Excel work for my Actuarial degree in university and I was lazy so I did what any ordinary university student would do; bought a discounted course on Coursera about Microsoft VBA so I could automate repetitive parts of my projects. This skill I learned on the side came in really handy at my first internship and contract job where I basically built VBA macros to automate tasks for companies while learning about the analytical side of things. I expanded upon my arsenal of data tools, picked up SQL, R, Python and thus began my journey towards analytical mastery ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
