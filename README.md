### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Danesh, an enthusiastic and optimistic data analyst working towards a career in data science. I had numerous Excel work for my Actuarial degree in university and I was lazy so I did what any ordinary university student would do; bought a discounted course on Coursera about Microsoft VBA so I could automate repetitive parts of my projects. Thus began my journey towards analytical mastery ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
